      ",  mitochondrial activity was assessed by measuring the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). MMP is a parameter  reflecting the functional status of mitochondria and it is commonly used as an indicator of the cellular capacity to pro - duce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [ 10]. It is well established that spermatozoa  with high MMP values are more competent than those with low MMP values in terms of oocyte activation and pronu - cleation [ 11, 12]. However, the relationship between MMP and embryonic development is less clear. Some studies  reported no correlation between MMP and embryo quality [ 13, 14] while others observed a positive correlation  between high MMP and good embryo quality [ 15, 16]. These discrepancies might be due to the different methods used to measure MMP. For instance, flow cytometry analysis requires large sample sizes, making it unsuitable for small samples such as spermatozoa. On the other hand, fluorescence microscopy allows the visualization of individual cells, but it is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity. Herein, we employed a novel method based on confocal microscopy combined with image analysis to quantify MMP in single spermatozoa. This technique enables the simultaneous assessment of thousands of spermatozoa within a few minutes, thus providing a fast and accurate means of analysing large datasets. To further explore the impact of sperm mitochondrial activity on embryo development, we treated spermatozoa with cyanide, a potent inhibitor of complex IV of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Cyanide prevents the transfer of electrons from coenzyme Q to oxygen, leading to a decrease in ATP production via OXPHOS. Interestingly, we observed that the treatment of spermatozoa with cyanide significantly reduced the rate of embryo development until the 8-cell stage. Moreover, we found that the presence of spermatozoa treated with cyanide led to a significant increase in the generation of ROS in zygotes.\n"
